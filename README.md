# School of Data courses

The goal of this repository is to contain all the courses available on the [School of Data website](https://schoolofdata.org/courses)

## Content

The courses are available as `.txt` files and the text is formatted as Github-flavored Markdown (GFM) format. The `.txt` extension is necessary to maximise the compatibility of the file with the various platforms we use, such as [Transifex](https://transifex.com). 

Markdown is a lightweight markup language with plain text formatting syntax designed so that it can be converted to HTML and many other formats [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown). Most websites which accept user-written posts or articles ([Wordpress](https://en.support.wordpress.com/markdown/), [Discourse](https://meta.discourse.org/t/discourse-has-a-new-markdown-parser/9318), [Github](https://help.github.com/articles/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/), [Facebook](https://medium.com/@suzanneyada/markdown-formatting-on-facebook-is-it-real-52eaf4495127#.n1pf4piii)) now accept Markdown formatting, which ensures its compatibility. The specific flavor of Markdown used here is the [Github-flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

## Translation

All files are available for translation in the dedicated School of Data [Transifex project](https://www.transifex.com/school-of-data/school-of-data-courses/dashboard/). 

We are currently building documentation resources (tutorials, glossary...) to ease the process of translating School of Data's learning content.

## Suggestions and errors

If you believe that you have found some errors in the text or if you have some suggestions to improve the content, you can act directly on Github:

* Fixing an error: By clicking on a file, and selecting "Edit this file", you will be able to modify directly the document. The changes made will be suggested to the Coordination Team, which will review them before integrating them.
* Submitting a suggestion: Github allows you to [open discussions](https://github.com/school-of-data/courses/issues) around specific problems or suggestions. These discussion are called issues, and will help anyone discuss your suggestions publicly if you make use of them.
 
## New content

The curriculum aims to provided condensed information that stays relevant for a longer time than, say, tool-specific tutorials. Consequently, if you wish to suggest new content for the School of Data curriculum, consider if it's better suited as a tutorial published in the School of Data blog first. Either way, feel free to contact the School of Data team via the website (for external contributors) or via internal communication tools (for School of Data network members). 

We are currently building documentation for writing courses that will ease the process of contributing to the curriculum.
